# Working example of Next.js 12 with Linaria 4 & Inline CSS Extraction

Ingredients for this to work:

- Next config by [@anulman](https://github.com/anulman) based on his comment at https://github.com/callstack/linaria/issues/589#issuecomment-1224287054
- Babel config from that same comment
- Server side inline css extraction based on https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/16784#discussioncomment-85563
